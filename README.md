# React Native Iconly by TGP

This is the react-native implementation of (Iconly)[https://react-iconly.jrgarciadev.com/] icons.

1. Uses .ttf files of the icons to implement instead of SVG.
2. This is the same format used by the most used react-native icons packages - react-native-vector-icons
3. Why not svg? .ttf compresses the actual size of the entire icon library down as well as gives the best possible performance.
4. Currently, Iconly Bold, Broken, and Bulk packs are implemented.
